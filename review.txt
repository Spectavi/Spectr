### Recommendations

1. **Refactor `SpectrApp` into a Composition of Small Services**
   - Create distinct classes: `StrategyEngine`, `ScannerEngine`, `DataPoller`, `
VoiceController`, `UIInterface`.
   - Each service exposes a clean start/stop API and owns its own lock where nec
essary.

2. **Introduce a Dependency Injection / Service Locator**
   - Pass `DATA_API`, `BROKER_API`, and configuration objects into services thro
ugh constructor arguments.
   - Removes globals, making it easier to swap mock implementations in tests.

3. **Centralise Configuration**
   - Move CLI parsing into `config.py` with a single `SpectrConfig` dataclass.
   - Load strategy/scanner defaults from config, not from the core app.

4. **Add Strategy Validation**
   - Define a simple protocol (e.g., `class StrategyProtocol: get_indicators() -
> list; ...)` and check at load time.
   - Catch `ImportError`, `AttributeError`, and log a user‑friendly message inst
ead of crashing.

5. **Graceful Thread Shutdown**
   - Provide `start_workers()` and `stop_workers()` in `SpectrApp` that set/clea
r events.
   - Each worker should poll its own event with a short timeout, ensuring no del
ayed shutdown.

6. **Thread‑Safe Collections**
   - Replace list‑based `self.signal_detected` with a thread‑safe `queue.Queue`
or `collections.deque` protected by a dedicated lock.
   - Consider `asyncio` queues for workers to eliminate manual locking.

7. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Decouple the GUI from the core logic: expose a `SpectrCore` that has no Tex
tual widgets.
   - The UI layer can then just subscribe to events from `SpectrCore`.

8. **Performance Considerations**
   - Current chart fetch uses a date range of one day per request every poll.
   - If polling is frequent, this results in millions of HTTP hits.
   - Cache recent candles and update only the delta (e.g., last OHLCV block).

9. **Security & Robustness**
   - VoiceAgent callbacks use global constants (`BUY_SOUND_PATH`, `SELL_SOUND_PA
TH`).
   - Validate paths on load; consider packaging assets inside the Python distrib
ution rather than external files.

10. **Documentation & Self‑Testing**
    - Add module‑level docstrings that describe the overall data flow (CLI → cor
e → workers → strategy → broker).
    - Provide unit‑test stubs for each engine (strategy, scanner, data poller) t
o validate expected events.

### Summary

`spectr.py` is an ambitious single file that stitches together CLI, data polling
, strategy execution, scanning, voice interaction, and a Textual UI. Its primary
 strengths are flexibility (dynamic strategy/scanner loading) and a reasonably c
lean layout of worker threads. The main architectural weakness is the tight coup
ling of all concerns inside a single large `SpectrApp` class, which hampers test
ability, maintainability, and future evolution (e.g., replacing the UI framework
). By decomposing the system into well‑defined services with clear interfaces, e
ncapsulating configuration, and adding validation for dynamic modules, the codeb
ase will be easier to extend, debug, and unit‑test.
